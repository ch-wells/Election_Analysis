## Election audit summary
This script could be modified for different congressional districts or elections at various levels by adjusting variables to the given input.  With a few modifications we could also determine which candidate each county leaned toward in the election.  And with additional data, it could also be used to examine trends in voter turnout over time on a county by county basis.
